# Illustrator Artboard Grids
A script for illustrator that allows you to set up multiple artboards with a main page size behind to layout files on artboards in a specific defined grid.

This project is designed to mimic the measurement setting from Seagull Scientific's BarTender software, but can be used to layout boards for anyone.

## Installation

* Download ArtboardGrids.jsx and place in a folder with other Illustrator scripts.
* Optionally change lines 41 & 45 to set a default page size.
* Run with "File > Scripts > Other Script" in Illustrator CC 2018+
